# ReadMe
<br />Using the built_in http module in this repo, I examined the requests and responses and took their logs and used them. <br />
After pulling the project, you can say "npm install" in the same folder and then run the code with "npm start".<br />
The application automatically runs on port 5000.<br />
If you want, you can start it with "node http_examples PORT_ARG" and run it on the port you want.<br />
