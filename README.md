# ReadMe
Using the built_in http module in this repo, I examined the requests and responses and took their logs and used them. 
After pulling the project, you can say "npm install" in the same folder and then run the code with "npm start".
The application automatically runs on port 5000.
If you want, you can start it with "node http_examples PORT_ARG" and run it on the port you want.
